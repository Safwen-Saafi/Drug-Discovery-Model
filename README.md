Lipinski's Rule of Five is a set of guidelines used to evaluate the drug-likeness of a compound, particularly its potential as an orally active drug in humans. The rule was formulated by Christopher A. Lipinski in 1997 and is based on the observation that most orally administered drugs have certain common characteristics. These guidelines help predict whether a chemical compound has properties that would make it a likely orally active drug.<br/><br/>

The Rule of Five states that, in general, an orally active drug has:

## 1/ No more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (the total number of nitrogen–hydrogen and oxygen–hydrogen bonds).
## 2/ No more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (all nitrogen or oxygen atoms).
## 3/ A molecular weight less than 500 daltons.
## 4/ An octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) not greater than 5, which measures lipophilicity and thus the compound's ability to dissolve in fats, oils, and lipids.
